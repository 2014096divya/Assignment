**(1). 	Explain the basic difference in structural behaviour between transversely supported stairs and longitudinally supported stairs.**
The main difference between transversely supported stairs and longitudinally supported stairs lies in the direction how the weight of the stairs and people using them is transferred to the building structure.
**Transversely Supported Stairs:**
* Imagine placing a plank across two beams - that's the basic idea.
* The treads (horizontal part of the step) span a short distance between walls or beams on either side. 
* They can be:
    * Simply supported on two walls or beams.
    * Cantilevered off a single wall or beam on one side.
    * Doubly cantilevered from a central spine beam (rare).
* The weight is transferred to the supports across this short span.

**Longitudinally Supported Stairs:**
* Think of a ramp resting on two landings or supports. 
* The entire flight of stairs, treads and risers (vertical part of the step) act as a single unit.
* This unit spans a longer distance between the supports at the top and bottom of the flight.
* The weight is distributed along the entire length of the stairs and then transferred to the supports at each end.

**(2). 	Describe any two transversely supported stairs with sketches.**
  1.	Simply Supported Stair on Walls:
Let’s take an example of a commonly used staircase. where the treads rest directly on solid walls on both sides. The treads bridge the gap between two solid walls acting like short beams. The weight of the stairs and people is directly transferred to the walls. This is a common and straightforward design for straight-run staircases.
  2.	Cantilevered Stairs:
Let’s take an example of a commonly used floating staircase with treads jutting out from a single wall. Like a cantilevered design. The treads are anchored to one wall and project outwards unsupported on the other side. This design creates a more modern look but requires careful structural calculations to ensure the wall can handle the cantilevered load.

**(3).	Describe any two longitudinally supported stairs with sketches.**
  1.   Straight Run Stairs with Central Beam:
Let’s take an example of a single flight of stairs supported along its length by a central beam running underneath.
	The central beam acts as the backbone, supporting the entire flight of stairs (treads and risers) along its length. This design is useful for wider staircases or situations where there are no walls on either side to provide transverse support.
  2.   L-Shaped Stairs with Landings:
This is a common design for L-shaped staircases where the stairs change direction at a landing. The landings act as the supports for the longitudinally spanning flights.
In this case flight of stairs (Flight 1 and Flight 2) acts as a single unit spanning longitudinally between the landings. The landings provide the support for both flights, transferring the weight to the building structure at those points. This design is ideal for situations where a change in direction is needed.

**(4).	State the rules for determining the effective span of longitudinally supported stairs as per IS 456**

*	**X	Y	Span in meters**
*	<1m	<1m	G+X+Y
*	<1m	>1m	G+X+1
*	>1m	<1m	G+Y+1
*	>1 m	>1m	G+1+1

**(5)	How are the loads to be distributed as per Clause 33.2 of IS 456?**
In the case ofstairs with open wells, where spans partly crossing at right angles occur, the load on areas common to any two such spans may be taken as one/half in each direction. Where flights or landings are embedded into walls for a length of not less than 110 mm and are designed to span in the direction of the flight, a 150 mm strip may be deducted from the loaded area and the effective breadth of the sectionincreased by75 mm for purposes of design

**(6).	Explain the design of the following transversely supported stairs:**
	**Isolated tread slabs**

• **Design:** Isolated tread slabs function individually, spanning across supports without a connected riser.

• **Support:** Common options include simply supported on walls/beams or cantilevered from a wall/beam.

• **Loads:** Live load (people's weight) and self-weight of the tread are primary considerations.

• **Design Considerations:**
    * **Thickness:** Adequate to resist bending and shear based on code and material.
    * **Reinforcement:** Steel bars embedded in concrete to improve tensile strength and prevent cracking.
    * **Deflection:** Needs to be within limits to maintain functionality.
    * **Connections:** Crucial for transferring forces in cantilevered configurations.
	**Stairs with waist slab**
• **Benefits:** Clean aesthetics, allows light penetration.

• **Considerations:** Not suitable for high loads or large spans, requires proper drainage.

• **Design:** Single concrete slab for treads and risers with a thinner waist section underneath.

• **Support:** Similar to isolated treads (simply supported or cantilevered).

• **Loads:** Live load and dead load (slab weight) are key considerations.

• **Design Considerations:**
    * **Thickness:** Overall and waist slab thickness depend on span, material, and code.
    * **Reinforcement:** Steel bars placed strategically to resist forces.
    * **Deflection Control:** Ensure entire slab deflects within acceptable limits.
    * **Connections:** Crucial for transferring forces in cantilevered configurations.

• **Benefits:** Efficient material use, clean aesthetics, good fire resistance.

• **Considerations:** More complex design, requires careful formwork for shaping the waist.

**(7).	Explain the design of the following longitudinally supported stairs:**

**Stairs with waist slab** 

**Design:** Single concrete slab (treads, risers, waist) - load carried along the length. 

**Support:** Walls, beams, or a combination at ends. 

**Loads:** Live load (downward) and dead load (slab weight).

**Design Considerations:** Thickness: Based on span, material, and code (overall & waist).

**Effective Span**: Crucial for load analysis (may differ from physical length).

**Reinforcement**: Steel bars placed strategically to resist forces. Deflection Control: Ensure minimal deflection under live load.

**Support Details**: Proper connection detailing for effective force transfer. 

**Benefits:** Efficient material use, clean aesthetics, open floor plan compatibility. 

**Considerations**: More complex design, needs effective span analysis, careful support detailing.

**(8).	Give the reinforcement detailing of dog-legged stair supported at:**
	
 **The edge of landing**

 **Main Reinforcement:**
•	Flights: The main reinforcement for the flight (inclined portion) consists of top and bottom bars. 
o	Top bars: Resist the tensile forces at the top of the concrete due to bending when the flight carries weight.
o	Bottom bars: Resist the tensile forces at the bottom of the concrete.
•	Landing: The landing acts as a slab and requires reinforcement in both directions (perpendicular to the flight and parallel to the flight).

**Bending Moment Considerations:**
•	Flights: The bending moment is highest at the edges of the flight, particularly where it connects to the landing and the supported wall. 
o	The top bars should be concentrated at the top near the support (landing edge) and gradually reduce towards the free end.
o	The bottom bars should be concentrated at the bottom near the support and can be curtailed (stopped) at some distance from the free end based on the analysis.
•	Landing: The bending moment is highest over the supporting wall and reduces towards the free edge. The reinforcement should be concentrated over the support and can be curtailed gradually towards the free edge.

**Shear Reinforcement:**
•	Shear reinforcement, typically in the form of stirrups (bent steel bars), is provided throughout the flight and landing to resist shear forces.
•	The spacing of stirrups is closer near the supports where shear forces are highest and can be gradually increased towards the mid-span.

**Additional Considerations:**
•	Bar Bends and Hooks: Bends and hooks are provided at the ends of the main bars to anchor them properly within the concrete and ensure they don't pull out under load.
•	Bar Lap Lengths: Where bars need to be extended or overlapped, sufficient lap lengths are provided to ensure proper transfer of forces between bars.
•	Bar Spacings: The spacing between the main bars and stirrups should be adequate to allow for proper concrete placement and vibration during construction.
•	Cover Concrete: A minimum thickness of concrete cover should be maintained around the reinforcement to protect it from fire and corrosion.
	
 **The end of flights**

**Main Reinforcement:**
•	Flights: Similar to stairs with landing support, each flight requires top and bottom bars. 
o	Top bars: Resist tension at the top of the concrete due to bending when the flight carries weight. These bars should be concentrated near the supported end (wall) and gradually reduce towards the free end.
o	Bottom bars: Resist tension at the bottom. They can be straight or cranked upwards near the supported end for better crack control.

**Bending Moment Considerations:**
•	Flights: The bending moment is highest at the supported end (wall) of each flight. 
o	Top bars should be concentrated near the wall and can be curtailed (stopped) at some distance from the free end based on the analysis.
o	Bottom bars can be straight or cranked upwards near the wall for improved strength and to help prevent cracks.

**Shear Reinforcement:**
•	Stirrups are used throughout the flight to resist shear forces.
•	Spacing of stirrups should be closer near the supported wall (where shear is highest) and can be gradually increased towards the mid-span.

**Additional Considerations:**
•	Bar Bends and Hooks: Bends and hooks are provided at bar ends for proper anchorage within concrete.
•	Bar Lap Lengths: Overlapping bars should have sufficient lap lengths to ensure proper force transfer.
•	Bar Spacings: Maintain adequate spacing between bars and stirrups for concrete placement and vibration.
•	Cover Concrete: Maintain minimum thickness of cover concrete around reinforcement for fire and corrosion protection.
