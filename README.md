**1. Explain the basic difference in structural behaviour between transversely supported stairs and longitudinally supported stairs.**
The main difference between transversely supported stairs and longitudinally supported stairs lies in the direction how the weight of the stairs and people using them is transferred to the building structure.
**Transversely Supported Stairs:**
* Imagine placing a plank across two beams - that's the basic idea.
* The treads (horizontal part of the step) span a short distance between walls or beams on either side. 
* They can be:
    * Simply supported on two walls or beams.
    * Cantilevered off a single wall or beam on one side.
    * Doubly cantilevered from a central spine beam (rare).
* The weight is transferred to the supports across this short span.

**Longitudinally Supported Stairs:**
* Think of a ramp resting on two landings or supports. 
* The entire flight of stairs, treads and risers (vertical part of the step) act as a single unit.
* This unit spans a longer distance between the supports at the top and bottom of the flight.
* The weight is distributed along the entire length of the stairs and then transferred to the supports at each end.

**2. Describe any two transversely supported stairs with sketches.**
  1.	Simply Supported Stair on Walls:
Let’s take an example of a commonly used staircase. where the treads rest directly on solid walls on both sides. The treads bridge the gap between two solid walls acting like short beams. The weight of the stairs and people is directly transferred to the walls. This is a common and straightforward design for straight-run staircases.
  2.	Cantilevered Stairs:
Let’s take an example of a commonly used floating staircase with treads jutting out from a single wall. Like a cantilevered design. The treads are anchored to one wall and project outwards unsupported on the other side. This design creates a more modern look but requires careful structural calculations to ensure the wall can handle the cantilevered load.

**3.	Describe any two longitudinally supported stairs with sketches.**
  1.   Straight Run Stairs with Central Beam:
Let’s take an example of a single flight of stairs supported along its length by a central beam running underneath.
	The central beam acts as the backbone, supporting the entire flight of stairs (treads and risers) along its length. This design is useful for wider staircases or situations where there are no walls on either side to provide transverse support.
  2.   L-Shaped Stairs with Landings:
This is a common design for L-shaped staircases where the stairs change direction at a landing. The landings act as the supports for the longitudinally spanning flights.
In this case flight of stairs (Flight 1 and Flight 2) acts as a single unit spanning longitudinally between the landings. The landings provide the support for both flights, transferring the weight to the building structure at those points. This design is ideal for situations where a change in direction is needed.
